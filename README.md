SDG Compass was conceived to cut through the clutter of daily sustainability coverage and give professionals, researchers and engaged citizens a clear view of progress toward the UN’s 2030 goals. Acting as an intelligent navigation system, it scans eight major outlets—including Guardian Environment, BBC and Reuters—then admits only stories that score at least 15 percent ESG relevance and contain two or more sustainability keywords, ensuring the feed stays both focused and high-quality.

What truly sets the platform apart is its E2SG framework, which interprets sustainability through an integrated lens that adds Economy to the traditional ESG triad, enabling richer insights into how environmental and social issues intersect with financial realities. Strengths such as domain-specific keyword filtering, granular SDG mapping, rigorous quality-assurance thresholds and forward-looking expansion plans—broader media coverage, sentiment and trend analytics, personalized recommendations, multilingual support and enterprise APIs—position SDG Compass to become the definitive tool for tracking, and ultimately accelerating, progress on every Sustainable Development Goal.

Behind the scenes, React and TypeScript drive a streamlined interface, while a Node.js scraper—relying on Google Search rather than brittle site-specific crawls—feeds the platform with 50–100 vetted articles each day. Cheerio parses the HTML, and an AI engine assigns every story environmental, social, governance and economic scores, maps it to the relevant SDGs, and filters out duplicates or low-value pieces.

Building within WebContainer restrictions forced the team to abandon Selenium and perfect an HTTP-only approach; they also had to craft multi-selector fallback strategies to cope with ever-shifting news-site layouts and implement throttling to stay respectful of source servers. The result is an 85 percent relevance accuracy rate and a consistently responsive user experience—even while performing real-time analysis and dynamic filtering.

Looking ahead, the roadmap includes broader source coverage (Financial Times, Washington Post, NYT), sentiment and trend analytics, personalized recommendations, multilingual expansion and enterprise APIs that feed corporate sustainability dashboards. The long-term vision is to make SDG Compass the definitive tool for tracking—and ultimately accelerating—global progress on every Sustainable Development Goal.
